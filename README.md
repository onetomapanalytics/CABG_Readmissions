CABG 30 Day Readmission Project

This analysis is focused on the CABG 30 Day Reasmission. In this analysis we tried to highligh main factors assocaited to unplanned 30 day readmission assocaited to CABG surgery. Fruthrmore, a detailed analysis was conducted to comapare the differences and similarities betweeen hospitals with low and high readmission rates. 
A logistic regression model was implemented with backward stwepwise elimination, and univariate analysis was performed, and all analysis was performed in STATA and R.

This analysis was performed by linknig Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State level(HCUP SID) data with American Hospital Associate Annual Survey (AHA) and Healthcare Information Management Systems Society(HIMMS) dataset for the Year 2009-2015. ICD9 codes were used to capture the primary procedure, and 30 day readmission was coded. Access to data is subject to a Data Use Agreement and authorization, all of the authors on this project have authorization to utilize this data set for research purposes.

We have made sure that all the analysis is thoroughly reviewed to be error free, furthermore all the results have been hidden that may lead back to tracing individual identiies. All the coding steps involved in linking, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling have been listed below with the name of each file. Code for all steps involved in cleaning, linking, pre processing, propensity matching and modeling has been shared.
